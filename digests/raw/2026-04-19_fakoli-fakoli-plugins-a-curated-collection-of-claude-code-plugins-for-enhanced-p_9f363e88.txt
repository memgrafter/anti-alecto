<h1 align="center">Fakoli Plugins Marketplace</h1>

<p align="center"><strong>Extend Claude Code with production-grade plugins.</strong></p>

<p align="center">
  A curated collection of battle-tested Claude Code plugins — covering Google Workspace automation,
  AI image generation, text-to-speech, diagram authoring, secure web fetching, and marketplace
  self-management. Every plugin ships with skills, commands, agents, and CI validation.
</p>

## Quick Start

Add this marketplace to Claude Code with one command:

```
/plugin marketplace add fakoli/fakoli-plugins
```

Then install any plugin:

```
/plugin install gws
/plugin install safe-fetch
/plugin install nano-banana-pro
```

## What are Claude Code Plugins?

Claude Code plugins extend the assistant with domain-specific capabilities. A plugin can bundle:

- **Skills** — Reusable context files that teach Claude how to use a tool or follow a workflow
- **Commands** — Slash commands (e.g. `/send-email`, `/speak`, `/fetch`) that invoke specific behaviors
- **Agents** — Isolated sub-agents for complex, multi-step operations
- **Hooks** — PreToolUse / PostToolUse interceptors that modify or guard Claude's actions

Plugins live in directories with a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest. The marketplace validates every plugin against a JSON Schema on every push and pull request.

## The Fakoli Ecosystem

Three plugins designed to work together — each useful standalone, all three together the full stack:

| Plugin | Role | What It Does |
|--------|------|--------------|
| [**fakoli-crew**](plugins/fakoli-crew) | Specialist agents | 8 polyglot agents (TypeScript / Python / Rust) — architect, reviewer, researcher, plugin engineer, integration specialist, documenter, infrastructure engineer, QA |
| [**fakoli-flow**](plugins/fakoli-flow) | Workflow orchestration | Intent-driven pipeline: brainstorm → plan → execute → verify → finish. Wave-based dispatch with mandatory critic gates between every code-writing phase |
| [**systems-thinking**](plugins/systems-thinking) | Architecture analysis | Multi-agent infrastructure analysis: discovery → extraction → synthesis. Built for decisions that affect the whole system |

**fakoli-crew** provides the workers. **fakoli-flow** orchestrates them. **systems-thinking** analyzes architecture before the workers start.

Install any combination — each works standalone. All three together give you a complete multi-agent development pipeline: architecture analysis, intent-driven planning, parallel agent execution, and evidence-based verification.

## Available Plugins

### Google Workspace & Productivity

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [**gws**](plugins/gws) | Full Google Workspace via the `gws` CLI — 100 skills, 15 commands, 11 role-based agents, and 44 recipes spanning Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Chat, and more. The most comprehensive Workspace plugin available for any AI assistant. |
| [**notebooklm-enhanced**](plugins/notebooklm-enhanced) | Programmatic control of Google NotebookLM — create notebooks, ingest PDFs and YouTube videos, generate podcasts and slide decks, and run end-to-end research workflows with a single command. |

### AI & Media Generation

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [**nano-banana-pro**](plugins/nano-banana-pro) | Generate, edit, and remix production-ready images with Google Gemini 3 Pro. Includes a 5-agent PaperBanana pipeline (Retriever → Planner → Stylist → Visualizer → Critic) that iteratively refines images until they pass a quality threshold. |
| [**fakoli-speak**](plugins/fakoli-speak) | Multi-provider TTS for Claude Code — stream any response as speech via `/speak` using OpenAI ($0.015/1K), Deepgram, ElevenLabs, Google Gemini (free), or macOS Say (free). Switch with `/provider`, track spending with `/cost`, toggle auto-narration with `/autospeak`. |
| [**excalidraw-diagram**](plugins/excalidraw-diagram) | Generate `.excalidraw` files from natural language or by analyzing your codebase. Supports flowcharts, architecture diagrams, ER diagrams, and dependency graphs across four color themes — zero dependencies beyond Node.js 18. |

### Security & Web

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [**safe-fetch**](plugins/safe-fetch) | Drop-in replacement for Claude's built-in `WebFetch` and `WebSearch` that runs content through a 6-layer sanitization pipeline before it touches the LLM. Neutralizes CSS-hidden text, zero-width Unicode, fake LLM delimiters, base64 payloads, and markdown exfiltration vectors. Security-team approvable. |

### Development & Workflow

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [**fakoli-crew**](plugins/fakoli-crew) | Summon expert agent archetypes — a Guido-style Python architect, code reviewer, API researcher, plugin engineer, integration specialist, and more — that work independently or as coordinated crews using wave-based orchestration for complex multi-step projects. |
| [**fakoli-flow**](plugins/fakoli-flow) | Intent-driven workflow orchestration — brainstorm, plan, and execute complex projects through coordinated specialist agents with a five-stage pipeline (brainstorm → plan → execute → verify → finish), critic gates, and evidence-based verification. Works best alongside fakoli-crew. |
| [**marketplace-manager**](plugins/marketplace-manager) | Create and manage plugins without leaving Claude Code — scaffold new plugins from template with `/add-plugin`, validate manifests, regenerate registry indices, and install GitHub Actions workflows. The tool that maintains this marketplace. |

/triage

# Generate a hero banner for your README
/generate-image "Hero banner with bold headline 'Ship Faster' on dark gradient" --aspect 16:9 --size 2K

# Fetch a webpage without prompt-injection risk
/fetch https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview

# Create an architecture diagram from your codebase
/excalidraw Diagram the architecture of this project

# Read the last Claude response aloud (defaults to OpenAI TTS)
/speak

# Switch TTS provider
/provider deepgram

# Scaffold a new plugin
/add-plugin my-new-plugin
```

## For Plugin Authors

### Create Your First Plugin in 5 Steps

1. **Scaffold from template**
   ```bash
   cp -r templates/basic plugins/your-plugin-name
   ```

2. **Fill in the manifest** — edit `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with your plugin's name, version, description, and declared capabilities.

3. **Build your capabilities** — add skills in `skills/`, slash commands in `commands/`, agents in `agents/`, or hooks in `hooks/`.

4. **Validate locally before pushing**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/validate.sh plugins/your-plugin-name
   ```

5. **Submit a pull request** — the CI pipeline will validate your plugin automatically. See the [Contributing Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for review criteria.

### Plugin Structure

├── commands/                # Slash command definitions

├── README.md                # Plugin documentation (required)

```

### Validation Pipeline

Every pull request runs three checks:

| Check | What it validates |
|-------|-------------------|
| `validate.yml` | Plugin manifest schema, required files, JSON validity |
| `pr-check.yml` | Preview of registry changes on pull requests |
| `update-index.yml` | Auto-regenerates `registry/index.json` on merge to main |

The schema lives in `schemas/plugin.schema.json`. Run `./scripts/validate.sh` locally to catch errors before pushing.
