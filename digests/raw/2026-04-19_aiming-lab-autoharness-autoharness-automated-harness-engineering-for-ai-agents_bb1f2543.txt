## 🤔 Why *Aha* (**A**uto**Ha**rness)?

> In LLM training, the ***aha* moment** is when a model suddenly learns to reason.
>
> For agents, the ***aha* moment** is when they go from "demo-ready" to truly reliable.

The gap is enormous: context management, tool governance, cost control, observability, session persistence... These are the patterns that separate a toy from a system. We call this **harness engineering**.

AutoHarness is a lightweight governance framework **so every agent can have its *aha* moment.**

> **Agent = Model + Harness.** The model reasons. The harness does everything else.

---

## ⚡ Quick Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aiming-lab/AutoHarness.git
cd AutoHarness && pip install -e .
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from autoharness import AutoHarness

client = AutoHarness.wrap(OpenAI())
# That's it. Your agent just had its aha moment.
```

## 🔥 News

- **[04/01/2026]** [**v0.1.0 Released**](https://github.com/aiming-lab/AutoHarness/releases/tag/v0.1.0): Three-tier pipeline modes (Core / Standard / Enhanced ⚠️), 6-step governance pipeline, risk pattern matching, YAML constitution, trace-based diagnostics, multi-agent profiles, session persistence with cost tracking. **958 tests passing.**


---

## 🚀 Quickstart

```python
# Wrap any LLM client (2 lines, instant governance)
from openai import OpenAI
from autoharness import AutoHarness

client = AutoHarness.wrap(OpenAI())
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5.4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Refactor auth.py"}],
    tools=[{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "Bash", "description": "Run shell commands",
            "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"type": "string"}}}}}],
)
```

```python
# Or use the full agent loop
from autoharness import AgentLoop

loop = AgentLoop(model="gpt-5.4", constitution="constitution.yaml")
result = loop.run("Fix the failing tests in auth.py")
```

> **[More examples →](docs/features.md#cli)**

## 🔧 Pipeline Modes

AutoHarness supports three pipeline modes. Choose the level of governance that fits your needs:

| Mode | Pipeline | Hooks | Multi-Agent | Use Case |
|:-----|:---------|:------|:------------|:---------|
| **Core** | 6-step | Secret scanner + path guard + output sanitizer | Single agent | Lightweight governance |
| **Standard** | 8-step | + Risk classifier + pre-hooks | Basic profiles | Production agents |
| **Enhanced ⚠️** | 14-step | + Turn governor + alias resolution + failure hooks | Fork / Swarm / Background | Maximum governance |

```python
# Switch modes via constitution
# constitution.yaml
mode: core      # or "standard" or "enhanced"
```

```bash
# Or via CLI
autoharness mode enhanced
```

> **Enhanced ⚠️ is the default mode.** Users get the strongest governance out of the box. Switch to Core for minimal overhead.

## ✨ What You Get

| Without Harness | With AutoHarness |
|:----------------|:-----------------|
| Agent runs `rm -rf /`, nothing stops it | **6-step pipeline** blocks it, logs it, explains why |
| Context explodes past token limit | **Token budget** + **truncation** keeps context under control |
| No idea which tool call cost how much | **Per-call cost attribution** with model-aware pricing |
| Prompt injection sneaks through | **Layered validation**: input rails, execution, output rails |
| No audit trail for compliance | **JSONL audit** logs every decision with full provenance |
| Agents share one permission set | **Multi-agent profiles** with role-based governance |

### Core Architecture: 6-Step Governance Pipeline

Every tool call flows through a structured pipeline:

```
1. Parse & Validate  →  2. Risk Classify  →  3. Permission Check
4. Execute           →  5. Output Sanitize →  6. Audit Log
```

Built-in risk patterns detect dangerous operations, secret exposure, path traversal, and more.

### By the Numbers

```
6-step governance pipeline   ·  Risk pattern matching      ·  YAML constitution
Token budget management      ·  Multi-agent profiles       ·  JSONL audit trail
2 lines to integrate         ·  0 vendor lock-in           ·  MIT licensed
```

## 🖥️ CLI

```bash
autoharness init                          # Interactive wizard (agent type, LLM provider, security level, pipeline mode, etc.)
autoharness mode                          # Show current pipeline mode
autoharness mode enhanced                 # Switch pipeline mode
autoharness validate constitution.yaml    # Validate a constitution file
autoharness check --stdin --format json   # Check a tool call against your rules (tool_name/tool_input format)
autoharness audit summary                 # View audit summary
autoharness install --target claude-code  # Install as a Claude Code hook (one command)
autoharness export --format cursor        # Export cross-harness constitution
```
