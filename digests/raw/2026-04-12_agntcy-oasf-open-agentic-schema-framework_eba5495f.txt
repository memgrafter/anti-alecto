The [Open Agentic Schema Framework (OASF)](https://schema.oasf.outshift.com/) is a standardized schema system for
defining and managing AI agent capabilities, interactions, and metadata.
It provides a structured way to describe agent attributes, capabilities, and relationships using attribute-based
taxonomies.
The framework includes development tools, schema validation, and hot-reload capabilities for rapid schema development,
all managed through a Taskfile-based workflow and containerized development environment.
OASF serves as the foundation for interoperable AI agent systems, enabling consistent definition and discovery of agent
capabilities across distributed systems.

OASF is highly inspired from [OCSF (Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework)](https://ocsf.io/) in terms of data modeling
philosophy but also in terms of implementation.
The server is a derivative work of OCSF schema server and the schema update workflows reproduce those developed by OCSF.

## Features

OASF defines a set of standards for agentic AI content representation that aims to:

- Define common data structure to facilitate content standardization, validation, and interoperability.
- Ensure unique agent identification to address content discovery and consumption.
- Provide extension capabilities to enable third-party features.

## Key Concepts

At the core of OASF is the [record object](./schema/objects/record.json), which serves as the primary data structure for
representing collections of information and metadata relevant to agentic AI applications.

OASF records can be annotated with **skills** and **domains** to enable effective announcement and discovery across
agentic systems.
Additionally, **modules** provide a flexible mechanism to extend records with additional information in a modular and
composable way, supporting a wide range of agentic use cases.

## Schema Expansion and Contributions

The Open Agentic Schema Framework (OASF) is designed with extensibility in mind and is expected to evolve to capture new
use cases and capabilities.
A key area of anticipated expansion includes the definition and management of **Skills**, **Domains** and **Modules**
for AI agentic records.

We welcome contributions from the community to help shape the future of OASF.
For detailed guidelines on how to contribute, including information on proposing new features, reporting bugs, and
submitting code, please refer to our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

OASF can be extended with private schema extensions, allowing you to leverage all features of the framework, such as
validation.
See the relevant section in the [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md#oasf-extensions) for instructions on adding an
extension to the schema.
An OASF instance with schema extensions can be hosted, allowing you to use your own schema server for record validation.

### Schema Versioning and Immutability

Once a schema version is released, no changes to that version of the schema are expected, except for non-breaking fixes
such as documentation updates or minor bug corrections.
Any deletions, additions, or structural changes made after a schema version is released will be part of the next schema
version.
This immutability policy ensures backward compatibility and stability for systems that depend on specific schema
versions, while allowing the framework to evolve and improve over time through new version releases.

## Useful Links

A convenient way to browse and use the OASF schema is through the
[Open Agentic Schema Framework Server](https://schema.oasf.outshift.com) hosted by Outshift by Cisco.

To deploy the server either locally or as a hosted service, see the [server's guide](oasf-server.md) for more
information.

See [Creating an Agent Record](https://docs.agntcy.org/how-to-guides/agent-record-guide/) for more information on the
Agent Record.

The current skill set taxonomy is described in
[Taxonomy of AI Agent Skills](https://schema.oasf.outshift.com/skill_categories).

## Creating Valid OASF Records with MCP Server

The [Directory MCP Server](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/tree/main/mcp) provides powerful capabilities to help create
valid OASF agent records when configured with an LLM (such as in Cursor or other MCP-compatible IDEs).
The MCP server exposes tools and prompts that enable LLMs to generate, validate, and refine OASF records with
schema-aware assistance.

### Key Capabilities

- **Schema Discovery**:
  Query OASF schema versions and navigate domains/skills taxonomy
- **Record Generation**:
  Automatically generate complete OASF records from your codebase
- **Validation**:
  Check records against the schema and iteratively fix validation errors
- **Format Conversion**:
  Import from MCP/A2A formats and export to other formats with automatic enrichment

### Getting Started

To use the MCP server with an LLM for creating OASF records:

1. **Install the Directory MCP Server** - See the [MCP Server README](https://github.com/agntcy/dir/tree/main/mcp) for
   installation instructions
2. **Configure your IDE** - Add the MCP server to your IDE's MCP configuration (e.g., `~/.cursor/mcp.json`)
3. **Start Creating Records** - Use natural language to ask the LLM to create, validate, or refine OASF records

### Example Usage

Once configured, you can interact with the LLM using natural language:

- "Create an OASF record for this project" - Generates a complete record from your codebase
- "Validate this OASF record and fix any errors" - Checks and corrects validation issues
- "Import this MCP server configuration to OASF format" - Converts from other formats

## Open Agentic Schema Framework Server

The `server/` directory contains the Open Agentic Schema Framework (OASF) Schema Server source code.
The schema server is an HTTP server that provides a convenient way to browse and use the OASF schema.
The server provides also schema validation capabilities to be used during development.

You can access the OASF schema server, which is running the latest released schema, at
[schema.oasf.outshift.com](https://schema.oasf.outshift.com).

The schema server can also be used locally.

## Development

Use `Taskfile` for all related development operations such as testing, validating, deploying, and working with the
project.

Check the [example.env](example.env) to see the configuration for the operations below.

### Prerequisites

- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)
- [curl](https://curl.se/)
- [tar](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/)

Make sure Docker is installed with Buildx.

### Clone the Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/agntcy/oasf.git
```

### Build Artifacts

This step will fetch all project dependencies and subsequently build all project artifacts such as helm charts and
Docker images.

```shell
task deps
task build
```

### Deploy Locally

This step will create an ephemeral Kind cluster and deploy OASF services via Helm chart.
It also sets up port forwarding so that the services can be accessed locally.

```shell
IMAGE_TAG=latest task build:server
task up
```

To access the schema server, open [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

To increase log verbosity for a run, set `LOG_LEVEL` (supported values: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`):

```shell
LOG_LEVEL=debug task up
```

**Note:** Any changes made to the server backend itself will require running `task up` again.

To set your own local OASF server using Elixir tooling, follow
[these instructions](https://github.com/agntcy/oasf/blob/main/server/README.md).

### Hot Reload

In order to run the server in hot-reload mode, you must first deploy the services, and run another command to signal
that the schema will be actively updated.

This can be achieved by starting an interactive reload session via:

```shell
task reload
```

**Note:** This will only perform hot-reload for schema changes.
Reloading backend changes still requires re-running `task build && task up`.

### Deploy Locally with Multiple Versions

Trying out OASF locally with multiple versions is also possible, with updating the
`install/charts/oasf/values-test-versions.yaml` file with the required versions and deploying OASF services on the
ephemeral Kind cluster with those values.

Set `env.LOG_LEVEL` in that values file (for example `debug` or `info`) to control runtime logging verbosity for the
dockerized server, or pass `LOG_LEVEL` directly when running `task up`.

```shell
HELM_VALUES_PATH=./install/charts/oasf/values-test-versions.yaml task up
```

You can combine both:

```shell
LOG_LEVEL=debug HELM_VALUES_PATH=./install/charts/oasf/values-test-versions.yaml task up
```

### Cleanup

This step will handle cleanup procedure by removing resources from previous steps, including ephemeral Kind clusters and
Docker containers.

```shell
task down
```

## Distribution
